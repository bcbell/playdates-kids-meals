__Playdates & Kids Meals__

This project is designed for families with kids. As a mother of 2 toddlers, I wanted to create an application that would be beneficial to parents and caregivers looking to kid-friendly meals, attractions, and restaurants. Offering families a unique varity of resources from entertainment and meal time.
